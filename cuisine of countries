        <h1><strong>Italy</strong></h1>
        <img src="OIP (2).jpeg alt=pasta from italy>
        <p>Spaghetti  is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.It is a staple food of traditional
        Italian cuisine.Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and
        minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined
        flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added.Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while spaghettini is a
        thinner form. Capellini is a very thin spaghetti, while vermicelli refers to intermediate thicknesses</p>
        <h2><strong>Japan</strong></h2>
        <img src="OIP (4).jpeg alt=shushi>
        <p>A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司, "matured fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been
        cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with
        rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. Narezushi is also called honnare, meaning "fully
        fermented", as opposed to namanare, meaning "partially fermented", a type of sushi that appeared in the Muromachi
        period.</p>
        <h3><strong>Mexico</strong></h3>
        <img src="download.jpeg">        
        <p>The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally
        theoretical. Taco in the sense of a typical Mexican dish comprising a maize tortilla folded around food is just
        one of the meanings connoted by the word, according to the Real Academia Española, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua
        Española. This meaning of the Spanish word "taco" is a Mexican innovation, but the word "taco" is used in other
        contexts to mean "wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person;  short, thick piece of
        wood." The etymological origin of this sense of the word is Germanic and has cognates in other European languages,
        including the French word tache and the English word "tack"</p>
        <p><strong>India</strong></p>
        <img src="OIP.jpeg"img width="200">
        <p>Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yoghurt that are
        roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken
        tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.The
        sauce usually includes tomatoes , cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and
        chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato 
        purée or with food dye.</p>
        <p><strong>America</strong></p>
        <img src="download (1).jpeg">
        <p>By the late 19th century, the vast grasslands of the Great Plains had been opened up for cattle ranching. This made it
        possible for many Americans to consume beef almost daily. The hamburger remains as one of the cheapest forms of beef in
        America.
        
        Adding cheese to hamburgers became popular in the 1920s. There are several competing claims as to who created the first
        cheeseburger. Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in 1924 at the age of 16. He was working
        as a fry cook at his father's Pasadena, California, sandwich shop, "The Rite Spot", and "experimentally dropped a slab
        of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger."
         An early example of the cheeseburger appearing on a menu
        is a 1928 menu for the Los Angeles restaurant O'Dell's, which listed a cheeseburger smothered with chili for 25 cents.</p>
