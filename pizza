<p>Don't cook your mushrooms until they're browning at the edges. Remember: after you saut√© them, you'll be spreading the
mushrooms on your dough and baking them in the oven. Just cook the 'shrooms until they release their liquid and are
tender (3 to 5 minutes), then immediately remove the skillet from the heat.</p>
