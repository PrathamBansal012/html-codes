<h1>PLEASANT GOAT AND BIG BIG WOLF</h1>
<p><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTv5KGvYF0o">LATEST EPISODE OF PLEASANT GOAT AND BIG BIG WOLF</a></a></li></p>
<p>Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf is a Chinese animated anime-influenced television series created by animation director
Leo Huang and produced by Creative Power Entertaining. The show is about a group of goats living on the Green Green
Grassland and a clumsy wolf who wants to eat them.Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf had 510 episodes when it premiered (2005–2007). After it became moderately successful,
Creative Power Entertaining created more than 2,000 episodes, including 60 exclusive Olympics episodes in 2008 and an
addition of 20 more episodes to the first season in 2009.

The first season was made using Adobe Flash, an obsolete video player.

In January 2009, its first movie Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf – The Super Adventure was launched in China. Based on
the 530-episode television series, The Super Adventure stars the same characters but in a very different scenario with
the goats joining forces with their old nemesis, Wolffy, to defeat their common archenemy – bacteria. It broke the
domestic box office record for a Chinese animated film, collecting 30 million yuan (US$4.39 million) during its opening
weekend. On the first day of release alone, the movie made 8 million yuan. According to Beijing News, the weekend's
revenue was well ahead of the previous record holder for domestic animation, Storm Rider Clash of the Evils – the
adaptation of the Storm Riders comic brought in 25 million Yuan in two weeks when it was released the previous
summer.
Describing the Pleasant Goat movie as a "dark horse", Zhao Jun, general manager of China Film South Cinema Circuit Co.
Ltd., predicted the film would make at least 60 million yuan in total box office revenue. A manager of the Beijing-based
Stellar International Cineplex said the movie theatre's biggest hall, which had been scheduled to screen Red Cliff II,
was reassigned to show Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Super Adventure in order to meet popular demand.
In 2010, a second movie, Desert Trek: The Adventure of the Lost Totem, was released. One of the original tracks in the
movie, "Left hands and Right hands" (Chinese: 左手右手), was sung by Yang Peiyi, who had previously sung at the 2008 Summer
Olympics Opening Ceremony.
In 2010, Creative Power Entertaining Corporation (CPE) said that it had reached a television license broadcast agreement
with Disney affiliate Buena Vista to air its products. With this deal, the popular Chinese cartoon show for children
will be aired on Disney channels in 52 countries and regions and in more than 10 different languages, marking a
milestone for China's animation industry.
The third movie, Moon Castle: The Space Adventure was launched in 2011. The fourth movie Mission Incredible: Adventures
on the Dragon's Trail followed in 2012. The fourth film reached the highest box office of the film series at 167.619
million yuan.
The fifth film, in 2013, was The Mythical Ark: Adventures in Love & Happiness, the sixth film in 2014 Meet the Pegasus,
and the seventh film in 2015 Amazing Pleasant Goat. All seven movies are themed on the Chinese zodiac of the year in
which it was released, and incorporate the zodiac animal in their Chinese names; the animals, sequentially, are the ox,
tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, and goat. In addition, all movies were released in the month of January, around
Chinese New Year. With the box office revenue of each film decreasing and Amazing Pleasant Goat only reaching 67.815
million yuan, CPE decided to slow down the yearly release. The ninth film, titled Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf 3D
Movie, is expected to release in 2023.

Two live-action animated films of the series, titled I Love Wolffy and I Love Wolffy 2 respectively, were also released
but neither reached a box office of 80 million yuan. A third live-action animated film is not planned.</p>

  </li>
</p>
<p>Looney Tunes is a media franchise produced and distributed by Warner Bros., which began as a series of animated short
films that originally ran from 1930 to 1969, along its spin-off series Merrie Melodies. Following a late 1970s
revival, a series of new shorts were released as recently as 2014. The two series introduced a large ensemble of
characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety and Sylvester, the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, and Porky Pig
among others. The term "Looney Tunes" has since been expanded to also refer to the characters themselves.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were initially produced by Leon Schlesinger and animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising
from 1930 to 1933. Schlesinger assumed full production following Harman and Ising's departure until 1944, when he sold
his studio to Warner Bros., after which it was renamed to Warner Bros. Cartoons. From 1942 to 1964, Looney Tunes and
Merrie Melodies were the most popular animated shorts in movie theatres.

Looney Tunes is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, spawning television series, feature films,
comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides. Many of the characters in the series have made and
continue to make cameo appearances in other media. Many shorts in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series are ranked
among the greatest cartoons of all time, and five of them have won Academy Awards. In 2013, TV Guide listed Looney Tunes
as the third greatest television cartoon series of all time, behind The Simpsons and The Flintstones, the latter of
which also had vocal talents from Mel Blanc and Bea Benaderet.In 1929, to compete against Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse cartoons, Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series
of animated shorts to promote their music. Warner had recently acquired the ownership of Brunswick Records along with
four other music publishers for $28 million and had become eager to promote this material to cash in on the sales of
sheet music and phonographic records. Consequently, Warner made a deal with Leon Schlesinger to produce cartoons for
them, who later hired Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harman to produce the first series of cartoons that would later become part
of Looney Tunes. Ising and Harman were hired because Schlesinger was impressed by a pilot cartoon they made, titled
Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid. The first Looney Tunes short was Sinkin' in the Bathtub starring Bosko, which was released on
April 19, 1930. Merrie Melodies followed suit with the short Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, which was released on June
13, 1931.</p>
